## About

This Visual Studio project contains two projects:
* GeekSquadMRI Crack
* MRI-Loader

The **GeekSquadMRI Crack** project compiles a dynamic link library that is used to bypass the expiration date built into the software.  It also removes its ability to contact GeekSquad servers.

The **MRI-Loader** project compiles to an executable that injects the **GeekSquadMRI Crack** library into the program as soon as it's available.

If any issues come up, please create an issue on this repository.
